                    <p>Yesterday I went on a rabbit hole tangent and researched the frontend frameworks, a classic.</p>

                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside p-4 space-y-4">
                        <li>Astro - spits out html with reactive islands but not all themes are 100 on all pagespeed benchmarks but the final straw that made me not choose it was the default out of the box blog template which had accessibility broken and a few other bad scores.</li>
                        <li>Solid - no vDom with hydration, SolidStart in beta but can remove hydration with Astro, SolidStart in beta so no api and routing :( Would use if solidstart was ready</li>
                        <li>Qwik - some vDom but no hydration, plus theyâ€™re peddling their other tool which is a complete turn off for me</li>
                        <li>Svelte - no vDom with hydration, slower than qwik, also performance starts to suffer as you scale your app, technically could couple it with Astro to make the front page super fast</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Anyway after spinning my wheels, I came to the conclusion that Sveltekit/Svelte is the best choice currently i.e. better than Next.js/React (which in turn is better than Nuxt/Vue apparrently) thanks to smaller package sizes and a baked in state management that people aren't fighting over (in Next/React people don't like hooks so they use Redux but some don't like that either so Zustand is being pitched but the easier syntax selling point just doesn't seem easier to me in the examples I've seen).</p>

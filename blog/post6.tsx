                    <p>Yesterday the inevitable happened that had me in this postion of no idea to begin with. I failed to find a new idea, hello brick wall! Turns out hitting it again didn't make it disappear ðŸ§±.</p>

                    <p>The advice is to talk to people before writing a single line of code. But very few people want to talk and those who do are not at a point in their business life where they're experiencing a hair on fire problem. The only problem they're experiencing is the old need more clients problem. Well everybody in the world does.</p>

                    <p>So the conclusion that I've already come to before is: build something small of value to lure people in to talking to me.</p>

                    <p>I mean what else can I do? What else is accessible to me at this point?</p>

                    <p>It's great to hear the romanticised best practices and theory until the rubber meets the road and everything is different and falls apart.</p>

                    <p>But if I can pull this off and not go back to having a 9-5 with every dollar being earned with work then it's worth going through the trouble of figuring out.</p>

                    <p>The only 'accessibe' audience I have that at this point in time (2023) that me (Simon) can get in front of and get responses with relative ease is LinkedIn. So maybe create a product for them?</p>

                    <p>Nb. I got inspired to get this idea of making something for LinkedIn from the aiCarousels.com creator and his "Building and Launching a SaaS in 10 Days" article.</p>

                    <p>To reduce the risk of siking my time into unfruitful projects which lead nowhere I should also cap the time investment to a week or so.</p>

                    <p>I will most likely go through a lot of duds so I must get those over with and in the process build up a reputation for myslef which I can later use to get conversations (as a founder).</p>

                    <p>So the thing I will do differently now is pick an audience and build something for them (small feature which adds value). I will do this without it being the perfect audience and the perfect feature / product, heck if it sucks it'll be better than just reading, researching and being stuck in analysis paralysis which I've entertained for the past 6 years, while others have been failing, building more and finally succeeding e.g. Pieter Levels "Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money and grew".</p>

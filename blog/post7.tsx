                    <p>Whoa, a bit of a whirwind of events took place since yesterday till now.</p>

                    <p>I came up with an idea and a plan to implement it last night.</p>

                    <p>This morning I had a call with Siddharth Sharma, the founder of YellowKyte, a company which helps SaaS companies with marketing.</p>

                    <p>In retrospect it makes perfect sense why these people took meetings with me i.e. the software agency lady thought I was looking for engineers/she may have seen me as a client. Siddharth on the other hand may have seem me as the client/future client after I introduced myself as a "micro-SaaS founder" (LinkedIn message below).</p>

                        <span className='font-bold'>Initial outreach message:</span>
                        Hi Siddharth,<br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Noticed your SaaS marketing company and overall marketing experience. I'm a micro-SaaS founder in the AI space and would love to exchange insights. Are you available for a 15-min call?<br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Thanks!
                    </p>

                    <p>Ok back to the main point. The meeting went very well and I ran my idea from yesterday (included at the bottom) past Siddharth without mentioning it following the Mom Test philosophy.</p>

                    <p>It seems that the he was using a tool which performed a similar funcition before but gave it up because it was too cumbersome to deal with and made little difference to his final result vs just using the vanilla default LinkedIn post input box.</p>
                    <h2 className='text-2xl font-extrabold'>Yesterday's Idea (discarded)</h2>
                    <p>
                        After 5 hours and almost giving up on the brainstorm I came up with the following idea. I wanted to avoid LinkedIn automations because itâ€™s illegal on LinkedIn, feature big & complex and there are a lot of products doing it already.

Also, there may be very little need for their product and their success may be subsidized by fans of their journey not their product per se.</p>

                    <h2 className='text-2xl font-extrabold'>The twist</h2>
                    <p>Siddharth told me that he stopped using these kind of tools and his posting experience hasn't suffered that much.</p>

                    <p>But at the end of the meeting he mentioned his current workflow and the tools he uses to make it 'stick' together. He uses an AI transcribing tool called fireflies.ai which outputs the conversation transcript but does a poor job at recording the screen / participants' video. He uses screenapp.io to take care of that. Finally he uploads both the transcript and video to Notion.so. The purpose of all this is to keep track of conversations and their outcomes e.g. whether he promised someone something or vice versa. So the next time he takes a meeting with that person he can reming himself of the interaction.</p>

                    <p>Now that I think of it, the former company which I worked for Testportal also used a third-party tool to transcribe conversations and uploaded them to Google Drive. But they experienced issues when people would forget to paste the transcript to a Google Doc in Google drive.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, it seems that there is a business need for transcribing conversations, recording calls and storing them, followed by retrieving them in an easy way before the next meeting with the same person.</p>

                    <p>Come to think of it I'm also struggling with managing LinkedIn connections and prior interactions even with simple messages. The only way to manage them is to look throught the chat history which becomes a big pain with lots of outreach messages. Additionally I have no way of tracking conversations outside linkedin and will forget that they took place after some time. There can be so many interactions on LinkedIn that this problem is inevitable with any substantial outreach.</p>

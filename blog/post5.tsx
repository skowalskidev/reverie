                    <p>This morning I did the scheduled call and as expected no real value came of it for neither side...</p>

                    <p>The lady which I interviewed thought I may be a potential customer and I've got a feeling she'd have not agreed had she known that I'm about to try and find out about her work routine and problems.</p>

                    <p>I have 2 more calls in the pipeline.</p>

                    <p>Maybe this isn't the stage to schedule calls with strangers.</p>

                    <p>It seems that those points where people are looking for solutions to some problem happen at various times and a blind interview has a low chance of picking up these insights.</p>

                    <p>I ran into this problem in the past while doing interviews while I was still employed. Back then I did the interviews after work. Another one of my traits on display, doing what doesn't work repeatedly because maybe it will work this time ðŸ˜‚</p>

                    <p>So once again I've come to the conclusion that I need to create something of value first to attract people who will want their problem solved better and volunteer to help me solve their problem throught emails/complaints and feature requests.</p>

                    <p>From this vantage point, the next in line accessible option for me to try is to copy some product (valiated demand) improve it and have people try it.</p>

                    <p>Or</p>

                    <p>Create content for the audience I want to serve and see what they're interested in? But then what if I become a failed writer, have to stop writing and be back to this point again?

Weâ€™ve hired our first full time team member! When we first advertised this job we didnâ€™t have a website, we didnâ€™t have any social profiles, but we had the work. So thrilled to welcome Luci Schalch to the team. This is just the beginning ðŸ”¥ ðŸŽ‰ No alternative text description for this image likecelebratelove 105 PostPost Everyone in social marketing HAS and IS talking about TikTok ðŸ¥±. But how I prefer to frame it is the actual format of the content... ðŸ“±Vertical video Yes, TikTok is huge right now. But so is IG reels, Snap & YouTube shorts. Not every brand has the capacity or capabilities to be on every single social channel. But each platform is currently pushing this content the most. My advice? If you aren't posting vertical video content on your socials, the best time to start is right now ðŸ“ˆ Shoot the video with mobile first in mind, then optimise for the specific channel. I guarantee it will grow your channels faster than that photo you posted on IG last week. hashtag#video hashtag#content No alternative text description for this image likecelebratelove 118 8 comments PostPost TikTok is not just a brand awareness platform.
